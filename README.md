# functional-programming

### Description

<!-- Wat doet je project (description) -->

### Features

Inside this repository i've cleaned our dataset from the University of Amsterdam. In this dataset the students gave a lot of information. In the survey it was possible to provide textual answers. With this textual answers there are a lot of different options, which means the same. By using some functional patterns I cleaned the dataset, and transfered for example all the colors to HEX, and changed all the textual numbers to integers.
